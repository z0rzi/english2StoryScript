## Installation

This all runs with NPM and python. To install node dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Python requires the library `nltk`, so you'll need to install it, with its used packages:

```
sh$ pip install nltk
sh$ python3

py$ import ntlk
py$ ntlk.download()
py$ d # -> to Download
py$ averaged_perceptron_tagger
```

## Still to do
[] Add argument detection
[] Better detection (add training data in the JSON files)
